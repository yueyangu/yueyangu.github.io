## Virginia Tech

### LLM-adaptation and Foundation Models for Building Energy Management	(2024-present)
- Validated the feasibility of adapting large language models (LLMs) across modalities for time series-based building energy forecasting, demonstrating that a fine-tuned GPT-2 outperformed or matched context-specific baselines using state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., TimesNet, Koopa, DLinear, MICN, and FiLM).

### Scalable and Generalized Energy Models 	(2023-2024)
- Established Transformer-based Generalized Energy Models (GEMs) based on 1000+ commercial buildingsâ€™ data. Both zero-shot and fine-tuned GEMs outperformed context-specific baselines across state-of-the-art algorithms.
- Enhanced computational efficiency by leveraging multi-core GPU-accelerated architectures.

### Generative AI-Powered Automated Infrastructure Management	(2021-2023)
- Established an unsupervised probabilistic framework for infrastructure exception detection utilizing the discriminant component of GANs and density estimation and optimized the configuration with ablation studies.
- Introduced multi-dimensional deep learning frameworks for multivariate data, showcasing the practical advancements in multivariate analysis compared to univariate one. 
- Conducted comparative studies against classic unsupervised methods in a real-world rail track exception detection case study.

## Southeast University	

### Performance of Stainless Steel Bolted Beam-Column Joints, Southeast University	(2018-2020)
- Tested 56 specimens of preloaded bolted connections, examined micro-mechanisms with 3D surface detection, and recommended practical surface treatment methods.
- Automated parametric modeling of bolted beam-column joints using Python-powered finite element analysis
- Based on experiments and simulations, proposed design theories for revising "Chinese Technical Speculation for Stainless Steel Structures."

### Performance of Cold-Drawn Duplex Stainless Steel Columns, Southeast University	(2017-2018)
- Performed axial compression tests on 13 square-hollow-section (SHS) and 13 circular-hollow-section (CHS) duplex stainless steel columns, compared test strengths with design strengths.
- Conducted finite element analysis on cold-drawn duplex stainless steel tubes under axial compression, validating the models with test results.

### Developing Biomimetic Straw-Based Building Materials, Southeast University	(2014-2016)
- Reviewed biomimetic structures inspired by beetle forewing and honeycomb designs and assessed the straw-based building materials industry and market.
- Conducted experimental study on a straw-based board reinforced by biomimetic double helix basalt fibers, analyzing its mechanical properties and resulting in a patented innovation.
