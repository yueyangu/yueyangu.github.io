Before I came to Virginia Tech, I had a master degree in Civil Engineering with a focus on steel structures. My Ph.D. research is in smart building/infrastructure management using artificial intelligence tools. I’ve been working on an unsupervised time series anomaly detection framework to facilitate the built environment maintenance and management (e.g., anomaly detection in railroad track condition, event detection in the building energy consumption). In the future, I’ll look into more possibilities of applying advanced artificial intelligence technologies in the lifecycle of building and infrastructure systems to build a more efficient built environment.

### An Unsupervised GAN-based Anomaly Detection Approach for Univariate Time Series
 
Developing efficient anomaly detection techniques is important to maintain service quality and provide early alarms in industrial systems. Many related work has been done based on comparative time series data, a ubiquitous form for measuring, recording and analysing the dynamics of different processes. However, most existing supervised approaches can achieve satisfying results only if there is sufficient labeled training data. The information contained in unlabeled dataset has not been fully leveraged. In this project, we proposed an unsupervised Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based anomaly detection framework. It only takes repeated normal time series data as input to train a well-configured Discriminator into a standalone anomaly predictor, and relys only on normal data for the validation process.

### Parametric performance analysis of stainless steel bolted beam-column joints (MS thesis)
- Parametric modeling of bolted beam-column joints were carried out through Python. 
- Studying the static and seismic behavior of the joints (relationship between bending moment and rotation angle, stress distribution and the yielding mechanism) with finite element analysis software Abaqus, proposing design theories and methods to support the revision of “Technical Speculation for Stainless Steel Structures” 
- Conducted an experimental study (56 specimens) in roughness and slip factors of preloaded bolted stainless steel connections, studied the micro mechanism of high/low slip factors with the aid of 3D surface detection, suggested practical and economical surface treatment methods for stainless steel.
