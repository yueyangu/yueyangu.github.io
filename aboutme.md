My name is Yueyan Gu. I am a Ph.D. student from the Charles Edward Via Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of Virginia Tech. Currently, I am a research assistant working with Dr. Farrokh Jazizadeh at [INFORM LAB](https://www.inform-lab.org/). I am also pursuing M.Sc.degree in Computer Science at Virginia Tech.

My research interest is in smart infrastructure management using artificial intelligence tools. My PhD work will be around this topic. Before I came to Virginia Tech, I had a master degree in Civil Engineering with a focus on steel structures. Currently, I’m working on an unsupervised machine learning method to automate the railway track anomaly detection. In my future work, I’ll look into more possibilities of applying advanced artificial intelligence technologies in the lifecycle of building and infrastructure systems to build a more efficient built environment. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, cooking, and singing.
